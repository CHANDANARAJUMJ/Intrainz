<h1 align="center">“I completed a three-month Data Science internship at Intrainz, where I gained hands-on experience working with real-world datasets using Python. During the internship, I was involved in data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building basic machine learning models using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I also learned how to evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I successfully completed all assigned tasks and projects and received a certificate of completion, which I have attached for verification. This internship strengthened my understanding of the data science workflow and enhanced my analytical and problem-solving skills.”</h1>
